# fc-squad-generator

FC Squad Generator is a JavaScript small ongoing project for practice and my own personal use.

The idea stems from the video game "EA SPORTS FC". A football/soccer simulator that allows you to create teams using players of your choosing. I became bored playing with the same selection of players (the best available to me), so I created a random squad generator to decide the team for me.

At it's current iteration, I have proritised the functionality of the generator over the layout and stylling of the page.
